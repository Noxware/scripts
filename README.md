# Scripts

This repo contains very very small utility scripts that sometimes I use.

## adb-wifi.py

Guided configuration of adb over wifi. Useful for debugging mobile apps in a real device without an usb cable. (a cable is still necessary for the initial setup).

## ext-fix.py

Check the mime type of all files in the current directory. If those files have a wrong (or missing) file extension, this script can add the correct extension to the file name. (The original extension is preserved as part of the filename).
